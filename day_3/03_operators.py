#these are the types of operators

# 1) arithmetic operators
# +, -, *, /, %, **, //
print(5 + 10)
print(70 - 30)
print(5 * 6)
print(50 / 2) 
print(100 % 3) #modulus operator (Tell us reminder)
print(2**5) #power
print(6//3) # Tell us nominator

# 2) logical operators
# and, or, not

# 3) assignment operators
# =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=

# 4) comparison operators
# ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
#conditional operators gives us answer in True and False
#equal to ==
a = 7
b = 7
print(a==b)  #0utput is True
#not equal to !=
x = 9
y = 20
print(x!=y)  #0utput is True
#less than <
z = 56
g = 56
print(z<g)  #0utput is False
#greater than >
f = 46
v = 56
print(f>v)  #0utput is False
#less than or equal to <=
age = 18
print(age<=18)
print("0pss! u are n0t eligible f0r licence")
#greater than or equal to >=
new_age = 20
print(new_age>=18 , "Y0u are ab0ve 18, please make ur ID card")
#print("Y0u are ab0ve 18, please make ur ID card")


# 5) identity operators
# is, is not

# 6) membership operators
# in, not in
