#we can say that variables are like a container that store values
#each each variable store different values, as some store strings, some numericals and etc
# example as like kitchen cabnients or boxes

# a = "i am a Future Data Scientist"
# print(a)

name = "Amina"
age = 20
goal = "Data Scientist"
#name , age, goal these are the variables that store values
#output
print(name , "Good name!" )
print("You are too young!" , age)
print("Woww Best Wishes!" , goal)
